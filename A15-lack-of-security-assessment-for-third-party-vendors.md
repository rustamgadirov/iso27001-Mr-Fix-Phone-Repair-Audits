## Finding Title: Lack of Security Assessment for Third-Party Vendors  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.15 – Supplier Relationships

**Issue:**  
Third-party vendors are engaged to provide services without a formal security risk assessment. Vendor access to systems and data is granted without documented evaluation of security controls or contractual security requirements.

**Evidence:**  
During review, management confirmed that vendors were onboarded based on operational needs. No documented vendor risk assessments, security questionnaires, or contractual security clauses were provided for review.

**Impact:**  
Failure to assess and manage supplier security risks increases the likelihood of data breaches, unauthorized access, and service disruptions originating from third-party relationships. This practice does not comply with ISO 27001 A.15 requirements for managing supplier-related risks.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement a formal vendor risk management process requiring security assessments prior to vendor onboarding. Include security requirements in contracts and periodically review vendor security posture throughout the relationship.
