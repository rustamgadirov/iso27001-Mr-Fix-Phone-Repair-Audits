## Finding Title: Insecure Use of Messaging Applications for Customer Information  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.13 – Communications Security

**Issue:**  
Employees use personal messaging applications (e.g., WhatsApp) to share customer information and communicate about business activities. These communication channels are not formally approved or managed by the organization, increasing the risk of unauthorized interception or disclosure of sensitive information.

**Evidence:**  
During inspection, employees confirmed that customer information is shared through WhatsApp messages. No documented policy governing secure communication channels was provided, and no controls were in place to restrict or monitor the use of third-party messaging applications for business communications.

**Impact:**  
The use of unsecured or unmanaged communication channels increases the risk of data interception, unauthorized access to customer information, and potential data breaches. This practice does not comply with ISO 27001 A.13 requirements for protecting information during transmission.

**Recommendation:**  
Prohibit the use of personal or unauthorized messaging applications for transmitting sensitive information. Implement approved, encrypted communication channels for business use and establish a formal communications security policy. Ensure all employees are trained on secure communication requirements.
