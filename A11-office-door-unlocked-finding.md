## Finding Title: Office Door Left Unlocked After Business Hours  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.11 – Physical & Environmental Security

**Issue:**  
The main office entrance door, which provides access to systems containing sensitive customer data and financial records, was left unlocked after business hours.

**Evidence:**  
During the morning shift, staff discovered that the office door was closed but not locked. No record of locking verification or after-hours security checks was available.

**Impact:**  
Leaving the office door unlocked increases the risk of unauthorized physical access, equipment theft, data compromise, and operational disruption. This condition does not comply with ISO 27001 A.11 requirements for securing physical areas containing information assets.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement an automatic electronic locking mechanism that secures the door after business hours. Establish a documented end-of-day security checklist requiring staff to verify that all entrances are locked. Restrict after-hours access to authorized personnel only.
