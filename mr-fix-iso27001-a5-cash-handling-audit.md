### Finding Title:
Lack of Documented Cash Handling Policy

### Requirement (A.5):
ISO 27001 Annex A.5 requires management to establish, approve, and communicate formal information security policies, including those governing financial and operational procedures.

### Issue / Nonconformity:
Mr Fix Phone Repair employees handle and store cash daily, but there is no documented policy defining secure cash handling or storage procedures.

### Evidence:
During interviews, staff described daily cash handling activities; however, management could not provide any written cash handling policy or documented procedure.

### Impact:
Without a documented cash handling policy, cash storage practices may be inconsistent, increasing the risks of loss, theft, financial discrepancies, and noncompliance with ISO 27001 Annex A.5 governance requirements.

### Recommendation:
Management should develop, approve, and document a formal cash handling and secure storage policy, including the use of a safe or locked cash box. This policy must be communicated to all employees and reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with ISO 27001 Annex A.5 requirements.
