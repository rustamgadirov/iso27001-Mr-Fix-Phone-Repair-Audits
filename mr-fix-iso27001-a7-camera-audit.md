### Finding Title:
Manager’s Office Camera Not Recording

### Requirement (A.7):
ISO 27001 Annex A.7 requires organizations to implement and maintain effective physical security controls, including monitoring mechanisms, to protect assets and prevent unauthorized activity.

### Issue / Nonconformity:
The camera installed in the manager’s office is not recording, leaving the cash safe area unmonitored and increasing the risk of unauthorized access or financial misconduct.

### Evidence:
During the inspection, the manager’s office camera was observed powered on but not recording or storing footage, and no maintenance or repair logs were available.

### Impact:
A non-functioning camera increases the risk of theft, fraud, unauthorized access to the cash safe, disputes that cannot be verified with video evidence, and noncompliance with ISO 27001 Annex A.7 physical security requirements.

### Recommendation:
Management should repair or replace the camera immediately to restore full recording functionality. A regular camera maintenance and monitoring schedule should be implemented, and all cash-related areas should remain under active video surveillance in accordance with ISO 27001 Annex A.7 requirements.
