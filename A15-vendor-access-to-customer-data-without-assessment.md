## Finding Title: Vendor Access to Customer Data Without Security Assessment  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.15 – Supplier Relationships

**Issue:**  
A third-party vendor has been granted access to customer data without a formal security risk assessment. Vendor access to sensitive information is provided without documented evaluation of security controls or contractual security requirements.

**Evidence:**  
During review, management confirmed that vendor access was granted based on operational needs. No documented vendor risk assessments, security questionnaires, or contractual security clauses were provided for review.

**Impact:**  
Granting vendors access to customer data without proper security assessment increases the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and service disruptions originating from third-party relationships. This practice does not comply with ISO 27001 A.15 requirements for managing supplier-related risks.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement a formal vendor risk management process requiring security assessments prior to granting vendors access to customer data. Include security requirements in vendor contracts and periodically review vendor security posture throughout the duration of the relationship.
