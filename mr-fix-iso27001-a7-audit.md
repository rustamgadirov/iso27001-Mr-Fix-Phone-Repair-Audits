## Finding 1 — Alarm System Malfunction – Smoke Detector Not Responding  

### Requirement (ISO A.7):
ISO 27001 Annex A.7 requires the organization to implement and maintain effective physical and environmental security measures, including functional fire alarms and smoke detectors.

### Issue / Nonconformity:
During inspection, the smoke detector at the back of the shop was found non-functional, creating a potential safety hazard by failing to alert employees and customers in the event of a fire.

### Evidence:
A smoke test was performed by a technician, and the smoke detector failed to trigger an alarm. Photo and video evidence of the failed test are documented.

### Impact:
A non-functional smoke detector significantly increases the risk of undetected fire, delaying evacuation and endangering employees and customers. This failure may lead to severe property damage, legal penalties, and noncompliance with ISO 27001 Annex A.7 Physical Controls.

### Recommendation:
The shop should immediately repair or replace the malfunctioning smoke detector to restore proper physical safety controls. Management must implement a documented weekly testing schedule for all smoke detectors, fire alarms, fire extinguishers, and other emergency devices to ensure ongoing functionality. These actions are required to comply with ISO 27001 Annex A.7 physical and environmental security requirements and to reduce risks to customer and staff safety.
