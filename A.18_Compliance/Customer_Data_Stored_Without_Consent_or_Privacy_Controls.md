# Finding Title: Customer Personal Data Stored Without Consent or Privacy Controls

## ISO 27001 Control
A.18 – Compliance (Legal, Regulatory, and Contractual Requirements)

### Issue
The phone repair shop collects and stores customer personal information (first name, last name, and phone number) in a physical notebook without a documented privacy policy or defined controls outlining how data is collected, used, stored, and protected in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

### Evidence
During management inspection, employees were observed recording customer personal data in a notebook that was accessible and visible to staff and visitors. Management confirmed that customer data is collected during service transactions, but no documented privacy policy or legal data protection documentation was available for review.

### Impact
Failure to properly manage and protect customer personal data increases the risk of legal noncompliance, regulatory penalties, customer complaints, and reputational damage. This condition does not comply with ISO 27001 A.18 requirements for identifying and meeting applicable legal and regulatory obligations related to data protection.

### Recommendation
Implement a documented privacy policy that defines how customer personal data is collected, processed, stored, and protected in compliance with applicable data protection laws. Replace manual data recording with an approved customer data management system, restrict access to authorized personnel only, and provide employee training on data protection and privacy requirements. Review the policy regularly to ensure ongoing compliance.
