## Finding Title: Ex-Employee Retains System Access  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.9 – User Access Management

**Issue:**   
A former employee still has an active user account on office software after leaving the company. This allows potential unauthorized access to customer data and internal systems.

**Evidence:**  
Current staff reported unexplained modifications to customer records. User activity logs show access from an account belonging to the ex-employee.

**Impact:**  
Retaining active accounts for former employees increases the risk of data exposure, unauthorized system changes, and financial loss. This violates ISO 27001 A.9 requirements for timely access removal.

**Recommendation:**  
Immediately disable or delete the ex-employee’s accounts across all office systems. Implement a formal offboarding process requiring access removal on the employee’s last working day.
