### Finding Title:
Weak Password on Store Computer

### Requirement (A.8):
ISO 27001 Annex A.8 requires organizations to implement and maintain technical controls such as secure configurations, access controls, and authentication mechanisms to protect information systems and sensitive data.

### Issue / Nonconformity:
The store computer, which contains sensitive customer information and financial records, uses a weak password that creates a significant security vulnerability.

### Evidence:
During the shop inspection, the password was found written on a label attached to the computer monitor, making it clearly visible to customers, visitors, and unauthorized staff.

### Impact:
A weak and openly displayed password increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, manipulation or theft of customer information, financial loss, and noncompliance with ISO 27001 Annex A.8 technological security requirements.

### Recommendation:
Management should enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements and regular password changes. The visible password label must be removed immediately, and employees should be trained on secure authentication practices. Implementing automatic screen lock and multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible is also recommended.
