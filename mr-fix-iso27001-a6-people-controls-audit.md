### Finding Title:
Employees Lack Training on Fire Evacuation Procedures

### Requirement (A.6):
ISO 27001 Annex A.6 requires organizations to ensure employees receive appropriate information security and safety training relevant to their job responsibilities.

### Issue / Nonconformity:
Employees are expected to respond to fire and hazardous situations, but they have not received any formal training on fire evacuation, safety procedures, or proper use of fire extinguishers.

### Evidence:
During interviews, employees stated they were unsure of the correct steps for using fire extinguishers or responding to fire emergencies, and management could not provide any training records or materials.

### Impact:
Without proper training, employees may respond incorrectly during a fire emergency, increasing the risks of injury, property damage, operational disruption, and noncompliance with ISO 27001 Annex A.6 training requirements.

### Recommendation:
Management should develop and deliver formal fire safety and evacuation training for all employees, including hands-on instruction on using fire extinguishers and activating alarm systems. All training sessions should be documented and reviewed periodically.
