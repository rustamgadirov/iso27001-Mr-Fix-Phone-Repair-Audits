# Finding Title: Lack of Documented Incident Reporting Process

## ISO 27001 Control
A.16 – Information Security Incident Management

### Issue
The organization does not have a documented process for reporting and managing information security incidents. Employees rely on informal communication rather than a structured incident response procedure.

### Evidence
During interviews, staff stated that security incidents are reported verbally to management. No incident reporting form, incident log, or written incident response procedure was available for review.

### Impact
Without a formal incident management process, security incidents may go unreported, improperly handled, or repeated. This increases the risk of data loss, service disruption, and noncompliance with ISO 27001 A.16 requirements.

### Recommendation
Develop and implement a formal incident management procedure that defines how incidents are reported, documented, investigated, and resolved. Maintain an incident log and ensure employees are trained on incident reporting requirements.
