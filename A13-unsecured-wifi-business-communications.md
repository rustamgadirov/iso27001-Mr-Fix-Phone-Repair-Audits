## Finding Title: Unsecured Wi-Fi Network Used for Business Communications  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.13 – Communications Security

**Issue:**  
Employees use the office Wi-Fi network to access business systems and communicate with customers. The Wi-Fi network is not secured with strong encryption, increasing the risk of unauthorized interception of data transmissions.

**Evidence:**  
During inspection, the Wi-Fi network was found using outdated encryption settings. Network credentials were visibly shared among staff, and no documented policy existed for secure wireless communication.

**Impact:**  
Unsecured communication channels increase the risk of data interception, unauthorized access to customer information, and potential data breaches. This condition does not comply with ISO 27001 A.13 requirements for protecting information in transit.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement strong Wi-Fi encryption (WPA3 or WPA2-Enterprise) and restrict access to authorized personnel only. Establish a documented policy for secure wireless communications and review access regularly.
