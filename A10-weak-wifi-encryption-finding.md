## Finding Title: Weak Encryption and Password Configuration on Office Wi-Fi Network  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.10 – Cryptographic Controls

**Issue:**  
The office Wi-Fi network is configured with weak encryption and an easily guessable password. Unauthorized individuals may gain access to the internal network and intercept sensitive business or customer information.

**Evidence:**  
During a management inspection, the Wi-Fi password was observed written on the back of the modem. Network settings confirmed that the Wi-Fi encryption method does not meet current security standards.

**Impact:**  
Weak Wi-Fi encryption significantly increases the risk of unauthorized network access, data interception, privacy violations, and financial loss. This condition does not comply with ISO 27001 A.10 requirements for protecting information through appropriate cryptographic controls.

**Recommendation:**  
Reconfigure the office Wi-Fi network to use strong encryption (such as WPA3 or WPA2-AES) and implement a complex password. Remove visible password postings and establish a policy requiring secure Wi-Fi configuration and periodic credential review.
