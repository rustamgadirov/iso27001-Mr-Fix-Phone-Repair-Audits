## Finding Title: Auto-Lock Disabled on Office Computer  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.9 – Access Control

**Issue:**  
The office computer does not have an automatic screen lock enabled. This allows the system to remain unlocked when unattended, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive business and customer information.

**Evidence:**  
During an inspection by the district manager, the computer was observed to have auto-lock settings disabled in the system configuration.

**Impact:**  
Without automatic screen locking, unauthorized individuals—such as customers or untrained staff—may access confidential data, resulting in privacy violations, data exposure, and noncompliance with ISO 27001 A.9 access control requirements.

**Recommendation:**  
Enable automatic screen locking on all office computers, configured to lock after 5 minutes of inactivity. Require staff to authenticate with their unique credentials to regain access.
