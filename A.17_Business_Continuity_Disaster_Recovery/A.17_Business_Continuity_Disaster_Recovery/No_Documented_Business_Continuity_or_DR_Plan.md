# Finding Title: No Documented Business Continuity or Disaster Recovery Plan

## ISO 27001 Control
A.17 – Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity Management

### Issue
The organization does not have a documented business continuity or disaster recovery plan to ensure continued operations during disruptive events such as fire, power outage, or system failure.

### Evidence
During interviews, management confirmed that no formal continuity or recovery procedures exist. No documented backup procedures, recovery objectives, or continuity plans were available for review.

### Impact
Without documented continuity and recovery plans, the organization may experience prolonged service disruption, data loss, and financial impact following an incident. This condition does not comply with ISO 27001 A.17 requirements and increases operational and reputational risk.

### Recommendation
Develop and implement a documented business continuity and disaster recovery plan that identifies critical processes, recovery priorities, and backup procedures. Regularly review and test the plan to ensure effectiveness.
