# Finding Title: Lack of Data Backup for Critical Business Information

## ISO 27001 Control
A.17 – Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity Management

### Issue
The phone repair shop does not perform regular backups of critical business and customer data to ensure continued operations during disruptive events such as fire, power outage, or system failure.

### Evidence
During interviews, management confirmed that no formal data backup process exists. No documented backup procedures, recovery objectives, or continuity plans were available for review.

### Impact
Without reliable data backups, the organization may experience prolonged service disruption, permanent data loss, and financial impact following an incident. This condition does not comply with ISO 27001 A.17 requirements and increases operational and reputational risk.

### Recommendation
Develop and implement a documented data backup and recovery plan that identifies critical data, recovery priorities, and backup procedures. Regularly test and review backups to ensure data can be restored effectively during disruptive events.
