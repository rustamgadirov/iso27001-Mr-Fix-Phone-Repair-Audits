## Finding Title: Unrestricted Access to Office Storage Area  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.11 – Physical & Environmental Security

**Issue:**  
The office storage area containing sensitive equipment is accessible to all staff and visitors without restriction or monitoring.

**Evidence:**  
During inspection, the storage room door was found unlocked, and no access control or camera monitoring was in place.

**Impact:**  
Unrestricted physical access increases the risk of equipment theft, unauthorized access to information assets, and operational disruption. This condition does not comply with ISO 27001 A.11 requirements for securing sensitive physical areas.

**Recommendation:**  
Restrict access to the storage area by installing a lock and limiting entry to authorized personnel only. Implement access monitoring through camera coverage or access logs.
