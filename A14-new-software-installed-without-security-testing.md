## Finding Title: New Software Installed Without Security Testing  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.14 – System Acquisition, Development & Maintenance

**Issue:**  
New software has been installed on business systems without prior security testing or verification of the software source. Installations are performed based on operational needs without documented evaluation of security impact.

**Evidence:**  
During review, staff confirmed that software was downloaded from unauthorized or unverified sources. No documented change requests, security assessments, or management approvals were provided for recent software installations.

**Impact:**  
Installing software without security review increases the risk of introducing vulnerabilities, malware, system misconfigurations, and potential data exposure. This practice does not comply with ISO 27001 A.14 requirements for secure system acquisition and maintenance.

**Recommendation:**  
Establish a formal software installation and change management process requiring security review and management approval before installation. Ensure software sources are verified, changes are tested, and all installations are documented prior to deployment.
