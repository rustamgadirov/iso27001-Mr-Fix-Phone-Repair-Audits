## Finding Title: Lack of Documented Operational Procedures  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.12 – Operations Security

**Issue:**  
Daily IT operational tasks are performed without documented procedures. Staff rely on informal knowledge rather than standardized instructions.

**Evidence:**  
During interviews, employees stated that system maintenance and routine operational tasks are performed based on personal experience. No written operational procedures were provided for review.

**Impact:**  
The absence of documented operational procedures increases the risk of inconsistent system handling, human error, service disruption, and security incidents. This condition does not comply with ISO 27001 A.12 requirements for secure and consistent operations.

**Recommendation:**  
Develop and document standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all critical operational tasks. Ensure procedures are reviewed, approved, and followed by all relevant staff.
