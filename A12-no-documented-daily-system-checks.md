## Finding Title: No Documented Daily System Checks  
### ISO 27001 Control: A.12 – Operations Security

**Issue:**  
Daily operational tasks related to electronic device repair and system handling are performed without documented procedures. Staff rely on informal communication rather than standardized, written instructions.

**Evidence:**  
During management review, employees stated that when issues arise during shifts or off-hours, they contact other staff members for guidance. No documented daily system check procedures or operational instructions were provided for review.

**Impact:**  
The absence of documented operational procedures increases the risk of inconsistent task execution, human error, service disruption, and potential security incidents. This condition does not comply with ISO 27001 A.12 requirements for secure and consistent operational practices.

**Recommendation:**  
Develop and document standard operating procedures (SOPs) for daily system checks and critical operational tasks. Ensure procedures are reviewed, approved, and consistently followed by all relevant staff.
